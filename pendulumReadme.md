# ðŸŽ¢ Double Pendulum Simulation using Lagrangian Mechanics

This project models and simulates the motion of a **double pendulum system** using **Lagrangian mechanics**. The double pendulum is a classic example of a **chaotic, nonlinear system**, meaning its motion is highly sensitive to initial conditions and exhibits complex dynamics even though the underlying physics is deterministic.

We derive the system's **equations of motion symbolically** using the **Euler-Lagrange equations**, solve them numerically using `SciPy`, and **animate** the resulting motion using `Matplotlib`.

## ðŸ“˜ Problem Concept

The double pendulum consists of two point masses \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) suspended by rigid, massless rods of lengths \( l_1 \) and \( l_2 \). The upper pendulum is attached to a fixed pivot, and the second pendulum is attached to the end of the first.

This system is governed by Newtonian physics, but instead of applying Newtonâ€™s second law directly, we use the **Lagrangian formulation** to derive equations of motion based on the system's kinetic and potential energy.

## ðŸ§® Lagrangian Mechanics

### Coordinates:
We use two angular coordinates:
- \( \theta_1(t) \): Angle of the first pendulum from the vertical
- \( \theta_2(t) \): Angle of the second pendulum from the vertical

### Position of masses:
\[
\begin{align*}
x_1 &= l_1 \sin(\theta_1), & y_1 &= -l_1 \cos(\theta_1) \\
x_2 &= x_1 + l_2 \sin(\theta_2), & y_2 &= y_1 - l_2 \cos(\theta_2)
\end{align*}
\]

### Kinetic Energy \( T \):
\[
T = \frac{1}{2} m_1 (\dot{x}_1^2 + \dot{y}_1^2) + \frac{1}{2} m_2 (\dot{x}_2^2 + \dot{y}_2^2)
\]

### Potential Energy \( V \):
\[
V = m_1 g y_1 + m_2 g y_2
\]

### Lagrangian \( \mathcal{L} \):
\[
\mathcal{L} = T - V
\]

### Euler-Lagrange Equation:
For each \( \theta_i \):
\[
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \dot{\theta}_i} \right) - \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \theta_i} = 0
\]

These equations are converted to a first-order ODE system and solved numerically.
