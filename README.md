# Data-Driven Engineering

This repository contains implementations of data-driven techniques applied in engineering, including optimization and physics-informed machine learning. The current implementation features a simple Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm for solving a two-dimensional minimization problem. The algorithm aims to find the global minimum of a quadratic objective function using swarm intelligence.
